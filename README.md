# Vandy Courts


**Project Outline:**  
VandyCourts is a fully deployed iOS application that connects tennis-playing individuals on Vanderbilt's campus. It allows users to create profiles, find others based on filtered criteria, message users within the app, and reserve courts once they have found a partner or opponents. Our client, the Vandy Rec Center, will be able to use this app to streamline their reservation system as well as encourage more tennis play.
